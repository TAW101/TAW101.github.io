# My Website
Hi, this is the read me for my website. I know that there are probably lots of things that I could do better. If you decide to point one of these things out, I would really appreciate it. This document should provide guidance on how to assist me best.
## How to contribute
Please flag specific issues, explaining why they should change and where I can learn more about this issue. I have never made a website before and am doing so to learn and challenge myself in interesting ways. Please do assist me where I have messed up, but I do not intend to make an industry standard website.

I hope this document is good enough. If not, raise an issue and I will probably do something about it.
## Roadmap
Note: I am doing this for my own sake and fun. Do not expect regular maintenance or updates.
### Home
I intend to make a home with information about me and my interests. I am uncertain exactly what implementation will entail, but I will likely explore multiple methods of implementation.
### Articles
I would like to write articles in areas I am interested in. I will explore how to implement navigation of the site.
